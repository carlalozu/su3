# SU(3) Lattice QCD

A repository for SU(3) lattice quantum chromodynamics calculations and
simulations.

## Description

This project implements SU(3) gauge theory computations for lattice QCD
research.
The idea is to provide efficient data structures and algorithms for manipulating
SU(3) matrices and vectors, which are essential in lattice QCD simulations.
We want to explore the difference in using an array of structures (AoS) versus a
structure of arrays (SoA) for representing SU(3) fields.
